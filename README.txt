vimdir
======

A clone of the handy `vidir(1)` utility that is part of the `moreutils`
package [1]. Essentially it allows you to edit the names of files and
directories with your text editor.

Current State
-------------

It is called `vimdir` because at some point it wants to be just like
`vidir`, but improved. But for now it is actually lacking features.

As of now, it might just randomly delete your $HOME. Run at your own
risk. It is also the first real Rust program I have written. So if I
am not using idiomatic Rust, feel free to correct me.
